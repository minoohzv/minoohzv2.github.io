            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am Minoo Hezaveh, and this is my 1<sup>st</sup> semester at Algonquin 
                College. I arrived in Canada two years ago and over this period,
                I studied English at uOttawa as an <abbr title="English Second Language">ESL</abbr> 
                student.  I love all different types of art, including <em>photography</em>,
                <em>handicrafts</em>, and <em>painting</em>.  I also really enjoy
                web development and programming, and I wish to improve my skills through this course. 
                I believe that web development allows me to express myself creatively 
                while also utilizing my technical proficiency. I have an undergraduate 
                degree in biotechnology; however, it is not a field I enjoy. For that 
                reason, I decided to follow my interest and passion, which has led me 
                here.

                In my free time I like to learn and practice coding. In fact,
                I started to learn coding through self-study. My favorite languages
               are <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr>,  
               <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr>, and JavaScript. 
               Thus far, I have followed YouTube tutorials and programming websites to learn
               more about programming languages.

               I love both <em>digital</em> and <em>traditional</em> painting. 
               My favorite digital art application is Adobe Illustrator because it allows me to
               express my creativity. Moreover, I have been an oil painter
               since I was 9 years old. I am familiar with choosing colours,
               and I know where and how to use each colour.
